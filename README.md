# CommandSaurus - A Prehistoric Command Line Adventure

*Step into a world where Unix commands meet Jurassic sparks!*

## Description

CommandSaurus is an interactive command-line interface (CLI) simulator that transports users back 160 million years to a world where dinosaurs reign supremeâ€”and they've learned a few Unix tricks! This playful tool combines system command parody with dinosaur-themed humor, offering a unique blend of entertainment and nostalgia for CLI enthusiasts and paleontology fans alike.

## Features

- **Dino-Themed Command Suite**: Execute commands like `roar`, `dino-facts`, and `fossilize` to interact with a prehistoric world.
- **Unix Parody System**: Familiar commands (`ls`, `sudo`, `cd`) reimagined with Mesozoic twists.
- **Escape Mechanism**: A secret dinosaur roar required to exit the simulation.
- **Dynamic Responses**: Randomized jokes, facts, and scenario-based interactions.
- **Anti-Escape Protections**: Playful resistance to conventional exit methods (`exit`, Ctrl+C).
- **ASCII Art Integration**: Retro-style dinosaur graphics for immersive storytelling.

## Installation

1. **Download the Script**:
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxfanboy4/commandsauras/main/saurs.py
   ```
2. **Run the Adventure**:

Hello! You're 160 million years back from your timeline.

CommandSaurus> ls
Why don't dinosaurs ever use cell phones? Because they're all extinct!

CommandSaurus> sudo
Sudo? You mean 'SO DO!' Get it? Because... you know... 'SO' enthusiastically!

CommandSaurus> dino-facts
Dinosaurs existed for over 165 million years, and they came in all sizes...

CommandSaurus> exit
Haha, nice try! You can't exit this way. Try typing the secret command to escape.

[After keyboard interrupt attempt]
Nice try! You can't exit by pressing Ctrl + C...
Type the secret command to escape: RAWR!
RAWR! You escaped the prehistoric command line!
```
